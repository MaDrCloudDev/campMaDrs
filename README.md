## [Render mirror](https://muralmadrs.onrender.com/) 

A full-stack application I developed using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node.js, EJS, Bootstrap, Passport, Cloudinary, & Mapbox - that allows users to find & review public art murals, or sign up & upload their own. CRUD & RESTful routes

Model-view-controller. Node-Express app, with Bootstrap components, EJS and CSS for templating. I added an example.env if you'd like to use this app, but updates will be limited, as I'm spending most my time on SvelteKit and T3Stack.
